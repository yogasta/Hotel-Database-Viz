# Hotel-Database-Viz
Using a sample data from a hotel revenue dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/govindkrishnadas/hotel-revenue) and used said data to create a database in Microsoft SQL Server. After creating the database, I connected the SQL Server to Power BI to make a simple dashboard to analyze the revenue from the hotels.
